# pix2pix-model
Implementing the pix2pix model to convert segmented images into real images of the environment
This repository contains an implementation of the Pix2Pix model, a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed for paired image-to-image translation tasks. The Pix2Pix framework is commonly used for tasks such as image colorization, style transfer, and semantic image segmentation.
Key Features:

    Custom Dataset Class: The Pix2PixDataset class loads and preprocesses images for training and validation. Each input image is split into two halves: the left half as the target image and the right half as the input image.
    Generator Architecture: Implements a U-Net-like architecture with downsampling (encoder) and upsampling (decoder) layers. Skip connections are used to improve the generator's ability to reconstruct high-frequency details.
    Discriminator Architecture: Uses a PatchGAN discriminator to evaluate the quality of generated images. The model compares the generated images with real ones to provide adversarial feedback to the generator.
    Custom Loss Function: A combination of adversarial loss (using binary cross-entropy) and L1 loss is used to optimize the generator. The balance between these losses is controlled by a configurable hyperparameter lambda_L1.
    Visualization During Training: Periodically displays side-by-side comparisons of input images, generated images, and target images to monitor training progress.
    Loss Monitoring: Tracks and plots the generator and discriminator losses during training for performance analysis.

Code Structure:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing: The Pix2PixDataset class and PyTorch's DataLoader manage image loading and augmentation.
    Model Architectures:
        Generator: A U-Net-based model with downsampling and upsampling layers.
        Discriminator: A PatchGAN model for evaluating image quality at the patch level.
    Training Loop: Implements a robust training pipeline with loss computation, gradient updates, and periodic evaluation of results.
    Hyperparameters: Configurable settings for learning rates, batch size, number of epochs, and the L1 loss weight (lambda_L1).

Requirements:

    Python 3.7+
    PyTorch 1.10+
    torchvision
    matplotlib
    PIL (Pillow)

How to Use:

    Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
    Download and prepare your dataset. Ensure the images are structured such that the input and target images are concatenated side-by-side.
    Update the dataset_path variable with the location of your dataset.
    Run the training script to train the Pix2Pix model.
    Visualize results and evaluate the model's performance using the generated images.

Results:

During training, the generator progressively improves its ability to synthesize realistic target images from the input images. The final results include:

    Realistic image-to-image translation results.
    Loss curves for both the generator and discriminator.

Applications:

    Semantic segmentation to RGB image generation.
    Black-and-white image colorization.
    Style transfer.
    Image inpainting.
